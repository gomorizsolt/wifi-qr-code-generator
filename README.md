# Wi-Fi QR Code Generator

This project was built just out of fun, to get a deeper understanding of QR codes. It's basically a revamped version of already existing tools, such as [QiFi](https://qifi.org/).

It doesn't compromise your credentials, everything stays on your computer. The data is _never_ transmitted to a server whatsoever.

## Stack

- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
